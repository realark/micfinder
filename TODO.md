MVP:
- [ ] Make moble rendering non-fugly
- [ ] password reset page

NEXT:
- [ ] trigger password reset page via email (instead of manual admin)
  - this will be annoying

If App Scope Grows:
- [ ] refactor existing code into sensible modules (config, persistence test doubles, unit test helpers, unit vs integration tests, etc)
- [ ] db migrations
