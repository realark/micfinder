MVP:
- [X] mic editor, UI for req fields, start time field
- [X] mic editor, allow empty non-required fields
- [X] mic editor, friendly recurrence picker
- [ ] Make moble rendering non-fugly
- [ ] password reset page
- [ ] guard against script injection

NEXT:
- [ ] branch protection and CI
- [ ] trigger password reset page via email (instead of manual admin)
  - this will be annoying

STRETCH:
- [ ] views for human friendly audit logging
- [ ] tools for db rollback/restore

If App Scope Grows:
- [ ] db migrations
- [ ] refactor existing code into sensible modules (config, persistence test doubles, unit test helpers, unit vs integration tests, etc)
